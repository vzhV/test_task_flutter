TestTask for "Solid Software"

Test task:

1. Install Flutter
2. Create a test application
3. The application should: display the text "Hey there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping anywhere on the screen, a background color should be changed to a randomly generated color (should be able to generate 16777216 colors using RGB). You can also add any other feature to the app - that adds bonus points
4. Please do not use any external libraries for color generation
5. Push code to a GitHub
6. Send the link to a GitHub repository back

Summary:
I made my program to change background every time you tap on the screen. There is also "Hey There" text centered. My program also shows the RGB parameters of the current background.
